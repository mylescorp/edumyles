# EduMyles — End-to-End Implementation Audit Report
Generated: 2026-04-04

## 1. Executive Summary

- Overall implementation completeness estimate: `68%`
- Critical blockers:
  - Tenant isolation is inconsistent: several Convex function files are exported without `requireTenantContext(ctx)` or the action/session equivalent.
  - Frontend auth/access control is primarily client-side (`AuthGuard` / `RoleGuard`) rather than enforced at the routing boundary.
  - Subdomain tenancy is inconsistent: code references both `edumyles.com` and `edumyles.co.ke`, while root `vercel.json` does not configure wildcard tenant routing.
  - `/support/tickets` is referenced in navigation but no route file exists.
  - Stripe webhook reconciliation is likely mismatched between Checkout Session IDs and Payment Intent IDs, which can prevent confirmed payments from matching pending callbacks.
- Number of modules fully implemented / partially implemented / not started:
  - Fully implemented: `11`
  - Partially implemented: `1`
  - Not started: `0`
- Repo mapping notes:
  - The requested `backend/` layer is implemented as [`convex/`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex).
  - The requested `shared/types`, `shared/constants`, and `shared/validators` live under [`shared/src/`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/shared/src).
  - There is no dedicated `infra/` directory; infra is split across root config files, Vercel config, env templates, and GitHub workflows.

## 2. User Panels Identified

| Panel | Route Prefix | Roles |
|---|---|---|
| Platform Admin | `/platform` | `master_admin`, `super_admin` |
| School Admin | `/admin` | `school_admin`, `principal` |
| Portal Admin | `/portal/admin` | School operations slices for admin staff |
| Teacher | `/portal/teacher` | `teacher` |
| Student | `/portal/student` | `student` |
| Parent | `/portal/parent` | `parent` |
| Alumni | `/portal/alumni` | `alumni` |
| Partner / Sponsor | `/portal/partner` | `partner` |
| Auth / Public | `/auth`, `/`, `/dashboard`, `/maintenance` | Unauthenticated or session bootstrap |

Notes:
- Role constants are defined in [`shared/src/constants/index.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/shared/src/constants/index.ts).
- Frontend route groups were mapped from [`frontend/src/app/`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/frontend/src/app).
- Tenant guards are implemented in [`convex/helpers/tenantGuard.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/helpers/tenantGuard.ts) and platform guards in [`convex/helpers/platformGuard.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/helpers/platformGuard.ts).

## 3. Backend Module Status

| Module | Functions Found | Fully Impl. | Stubs/Partial | Missing | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| SIS | 12 | 12 | 0 | 0 | Tenant-guarded; schema references resolve cleanly. |
| Admissions | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | Core query/mutation coverage present. |
| Finance | 18 | 17 | 1 | 0 | Real payment flows exist; Stripe reconciliation risk remains. |
| Timetable | 11 | 11 | 0 | 0 | Backend logic is implemented; frontend still partial. |
| Academics | 22 | 22 | 0 | 0 | Strong backend coverage for classes, exams, grading, assignments. |
| HR | 22 | 22 | 0 | 0 | Payroll/leave/performance functions exist. |
| Library | 11 | 11 | 0 | 0 | Circulation + inventory logic implemented. |
| Transport | 15 | 15 | 0 | 0 | Routing/tracking functions present. |
| Communications | 62 | 58 | 4 | 0 | SMS/email/push exist; a few files are not tenant-guarded and parent announcements use a notifications proxy. |
| E-wallet | 19 | 19 | 0 | 0 | Backend wallet flows exist; UI still partial. |
| E-commerce | 12 | 12 | 0 | 0 | Product/order backend is present. |
| Platform | 354 | 320 | 34 | 0 | Broadest surface area; many features exist but several panels still expose placeholder UI and a few files are not guard-first. |

Supporting findings:
- Cross-check of `ctx.db.query("table")` and `withIndex("index")` references against [`convex/schema.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/schema.ts) found no missing tables or indexes.
- Scheduled work is wired in [`convex/crons.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/crons.ts), but payment reconciliation is limited to stale callback cleanup rather than active provider polling.

## 5. Missing Features — Prioritized List

### CRITICAL
| Module | Panel | Feature | What's Missing | Suggested Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auth / Tenant Security | All | Server-side route protection | Route access is mainly client-side through `AuthGuard` and `RoleGuard`. | Add middleware or server-layout/session enforcement at route boundaries. |
| Tenant Isolation | Backend | Guard-first enforcement | Multiple Convex files export functions without tenant guard equivalents. | Require `requireTenantContext`, `requireTenantSession`, or explicit platform/public exemption per file. |
| Routing | Teacher / Student / Parent / Alumni / Partner | Support tickets | `/support/tickets` exists in nav but no route file exists. | Create route or remove links from nav config. |
| Payments | Parent / Finance | Stripe webhook reconciliation | Pending callbacks are tied to Checkout Session IDs, while success webhooks may arrive on Payment Intent IDs. | Normalize and persist both IDs, or reconcile by metadata/order reference. |
| Infra / Tenancy | All | Wildcard tenant hosting | No clear wildcard Vercel routing for tenant subdomains at root. | Add explicit wildcard domain/routing configuration and align domains. |

### HIGH
| Module | Panel | Feature | What's Missing | Suggested Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Platform | Platform Admin | Tickets alternate views | Kanban and calendar views are surfaced but explicitly not implemented. | Hide unfinished views or build them fully. |
| Timetable | School Admin | Auto-planning builder | Admin timetable page says drag/drop auto-planning is not implemented. | Complete scheduler UX or remove promise from UI. |
| Communications | Parent | Announcements feed | Parent announcements currently use notifications as a proxy. | Add a dedicated announcements query/model. |
| Platform | Platform Admin | Health export | Export action is still not wired. | Connect export UI to backend/report generation. |
| Platform | Platform Admin | Automation workflows | Builder and execution drill-down remain partial. | Finish workflow persistence and execution visibility. |
| Docs | Engineering | Implementation accuracy | Several docs still describe backend/mobile as placeholders even though code exists. | Update docs to match the current implementation. |

### MEDIUM
| Module | Panel | Feature | What's Missing | Suggested Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E-wallet | Student / Admin | Wallet transfer/topup UX | Core page exists, but transaction subflows remain partial. | Finish mutations, validation, and confirmations on wallet child routes. |
| HR / Library / Transport / E-commerce | School Admin | CRUD completion | Many pages have live scaffolds but still include placeholder states or incomplete CRUD. | Close route-by-route gaps with validation, empty states, delete confirms, and pagination. |
| Notifications | All portals | Notifications pages | Several notification pages are static shells despite backend notification support existing. | Wire each page to real notification queries and mark-read mutations. |
| Platform Marketplace | Platform Admin | Top-level marketplace management | Page structure exists but remains placeholder-heavy. | Finish create/update moderation flows and persist settings. |

### LOW
| Module | Panel | Feature | What's Missing | Suggested Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UI Consistency | Multiple | Placeholder copy in production pages | Several pages still expose “not implemented yet” messaging. | Replace with feature flags or hide incomplete controls. |
| Internationalization | All | Localized content | Docs acknowledge no i18n. | Add locale strategy once core workflows are stable. |

## 6. Payment Integration Status

| Provider | Initiation | Callback / Webhook | Ledger Posting | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M-Pesa Daraja | Yes | Yes | Yes | ✅ Strongest of the payment paths |
| Airtel Money | Yes | Yes | Yes | ✅ Implemented, though it leans on shared finance reconciliation |
| Stripe | Yes | Yes | Partial | ⚠️ Webhook matching risk can break automatic posting for some successful payments |
| Bank Transfer | Yes | Manual verification route exists | Yes | ✅ Manual review flow implemented |

Notes:
- Payment posting into student finance records is handled in [`convex/modules/finance/mutations.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/finance/mutations.ts).
- Provider actions live under [`convex/actions/payments/`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/actions/payments).
- Webhooks live under [`frontend/src/app/api/webhooks/`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/frontend/src/app/api/webhooks).

## 7. Communication Integration Status

| Channel | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SMS | ✅ Implemented | Africa's Talking is wired via [`convex/actions/communications/sms.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/actions/communications/sms.ts). |
| Email | ✅ Implemented | Resend + React Email templates are wired via [`convex/actions/communications/email.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/actions/communications/email.ts) and email templates in communications modules. |
| In-app | ✅ Implemented | Notification creation and mark-read flows exist. Several frontend notification pages are still incomplete. |
| Push | ✅ Implemented | Expo push action exists in [`convex/actions/communications/push.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/actions/communications/push.ts). |

## 8. Mobile App Status

- Implemented screens:
  - `LoginScreen`
  - `DashboardScreen`
  - `AssignmentsScreen`
  - `AttendanceScreen`
  - `FeesScreen`
  - `GradesScreen`
  - `ProfileScreen`
- Mobile backend connectivity:
  - Convex is wired through [`mobile/src/lib/convexApi.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/mobile/src/lib/convexApi.ts).
  - Offline/poor-connectivity handling exists through [`mobile/src/hooks/useOfflineSync.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/mobile/src/hooks/useOfflineSync.ts).
  - Mobile auth exists through a browser-assisted login flow in [`mobile/src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/mobile/src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx).
- Coverage by panel:
  - Student: partial coverage
  - Parent: partial coverage
  - Teacher: partial coverage
  - School Admin / Platform Admin / Alumni / Partner: effectively web-only
- Audit note:
  - The current codebase is materially ahead of the docs; docs still describe mobile as a placeholder, but the app now has real screens and real backend integration.

## 9. Auth & Tenant Isolation Issues

- Critical tenant-guard gaps found in exported Convex files:
  - [`convex/modules/communications/email.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/communications/email.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/communications/platform.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/communications/platform.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/communications/sms.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/communications/sms.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/marketplace/platform.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/marketplace/platform.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/marketplace/seed.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/marketplace/seed.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/pm/deploys.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/pm/deploys.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/pm/epics.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/pm/epics.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/pm/github.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/pm/github.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/pm/projects.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/pm/projects.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/pm/tasks.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/pm/tasks.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/pm/timeLogs.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/pm/timeLogs.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/pm/workspaces.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/pm/workspaces.ts)
  - [`convex/modules/portal/student/testQuery.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/modules/portal/student/testQuery.ts)
- Possible intentional exceptions exist for auth/platform/system helpers, but tenant-scoped files should be treated as security review items until explicitly exempted.
- Frontend access control concerns:
  - [`frontend/src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/frontend/src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx) and [`frontend/src/components/shared/RoleGuard.tsx`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/frontend/src/components/shared/RoleGuard.tsx) are client-side guards.
  - Several portal layouts allow elevated roles into end-user portals, which increases accidental overexposure risk.
- Tenant routing inconsistency:
  - [`frontend/src/app/api/tenant-handler/route.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/frontend/src/app/api/tenant-handler/route.ts) assumes `*.edumyles.com`.
  - Multiple tenant UI components display `*.edumyles.co.ke`.

## 10. Shared Layer Gaps

- Types:
  - [`shared/src/types/index.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/shared/src/types/index.ts) covers many major entities, but it does not mirror the full breadth of the Convex schema surface.
- Validators:
  - [`shared/src/validators/index.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/shared/src/validators/index.ts) contains strong shared schemas, but not every domain form in the frontend is clearly reusing them.
- Constants:
  - [`shared/src/constants/index.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/shared/src/constants/index.ts) is fairly complete and includes East African countries/currencies and curriculum codes.
  - There is still a compatibility alias where `platform_admin` is transformed to `super_admin`, which is a migration smell worth cleaning up.

## 11. Infra & CI/CD Gaps

- Vercel / routing:
  - Root [`vercel.json`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/vercel.json) does not clearly define wildcard tenant subdomain behavior.
- Environment docs:
  - [`.env.example`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/.env.example) is broad and mostly complete, but some platform domain assumptions are inconsistent with the UI.
- CI/CD:
  - GitHub workflows exist and are meaningful:
    - [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/.github/workflows/ci.yml)
    - [`.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml)
    - [`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml)
- Tests:
  - Test tooling is present: Vitest, Playwright, and mobile tests.
  - Coverage exists, but this audit did not execute the full suite.
- Seed / migration strategy:
  - Seed paths exist in [`convex/dev/seed.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/convex/dev/seed.ts), [`scripts/seed.ts`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/scripts/seed.ts), and [`scripts/seed-cli.mjs`](/c:/Users/Admin/Projects/edumyles/scripts/seed-cli.mjs).

## 12. Recommended Implementation Priority Order

1. Enforce tenant isolation and auth at the server boundary.
2. Fix wildcard tenant routing and align all domains to one canonical root domain.
3. Repair Stripe reconciliation so successful webhooks always match pending finance records.
4. Remove or implement broken nav targets, starting with `/support/tickets`.
5. Finish platform ticketing views and hide unfinished controls until complete.
6. Complete notifications pages across student, parent, teacher, alumni, and partner portals using existing backend notification APIs.
7. Finish the highest-traffic school admin workflows: students, staff, finance invoices/fees, timetable planning.
8. Replace proxy announcement logic for parents with a dedicated announcements model/query.
9. Finish student wallet subflows and admin e-wallet management routes.
10. Update stale docs so architecture, backend status, and mobile status reflect the actual codebase.
